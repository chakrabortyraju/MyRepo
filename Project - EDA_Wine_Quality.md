## ANALYSIS OF THE DATASET
### Understanding the available wine qualities.

- Looks like most of the wine have average quality of 6. There are very few wines with poor and high quality.

### Understanding the available wine qualities based on redefined categories.

- Quality scores are distributed in three categories -- poor [3 to 4], normal [5 to 6] and excellent [7 to 9]. As expected, majority falls under normal category.

### Relationship between Attribute Variables.

- From above we can see, there is a strong positive correlation of density with residual sugar. However, a strong negative correlation of density and alcohol.
- Also, there is no correlation between free sulphur dioxide and quality.
