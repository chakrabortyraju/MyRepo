Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib

### Machine Learning

**Linear Regression:**
- **Predicting Boston Housing Prices:** A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
- **Supervised Learning:** Finding Donors for CharityML: Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Creating Customer Segments: Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame

**ML Logistic Regression:**

- Predicting salary class of a person using logistic regression.
