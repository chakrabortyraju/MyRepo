### Practice Dataset
- **McDonalds:** Based on cultural and economic similarities/dissimilarities throughout the world, how can McDonald's expand in the developing countries in the near future?

Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib

- **Mental Health in tech Workshop:** This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.

Tools: Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib

### Practice Dataset (Advertising Data Set)
- **Predicting Output Sales, given input budgets for TV, radio and newspaper:** A model to predict Sales (in thousands of units) for a particular product as a function of advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) for TV, radio, and newspaper media. Suppose that in our role as Data Scientist we are asked to suggest.

### Practice Dataset (Titanic Data Set)
- **Predicting the Survival of Titanic Passengers:** This study used the datasets to make prediction on the survival outcome of passengers in the tested data with a model built from the trained dataset. Since this is a binary outcome prediction, the logistic regression analysis was used to model.
