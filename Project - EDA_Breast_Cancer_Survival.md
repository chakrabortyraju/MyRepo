## WHAT IS BREAST CANCER?

**Breast cancer** is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer.

The average **5-year survival rate** for women with invasive breast cancer is **90%**. The average **10-year survival rate is 83%**. If the cancer is located only in the breast, the **5-year survival rate of women with breast cancer is 99%**. Sixty-two percent **(62%)** of people with breast cancer are diagnosed with this stage.

Breast cancer can spread outside the breast through blood vessels and lymph vessels. When breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is said to have metastasized.
## ROLE OF POSITIVE AXILLARY NODES IN BREAST CANCER

The lymphatic system is one of the body's primary tools for fighting infection. This system contains lymph fluid and lymph nodes, which occur in critical areas in the body. Cancer cells sometimes enter and build up in the lymph system.

The **number of axillary lymph nodes** can vary from person to person, ranging from **five nodes to more than 30**. After a breast cancer diagnosis, a doctor will often check whether cancer cells have spread to the axillary lymph nodes.
## DETAILS OF THE SOURCE DATASET
**Variables Details:**
- Number of variables: 4
- Number of observations: 306
- Missing cells: 0 (0.0%)
- Duplicate rows 17 (5.6%)

**Variables types:**
- Numeric = 4
- Categorical = 0
- Text (Unique) = 0
- Rejected = 0

**Column Names and Descriptions:**
1. Age: Age of patient at the time of operation.
2. Years_of_operation: Patient’s year of operation.
3. Pos_axillary_nodes: Number of positive axillary nodes detected.
4. Status: The patient survived/died within number of years.
## ANALYSIS OF THE DATASET
1. **Question: What is the percentage of Survived/Dead Patients?**
